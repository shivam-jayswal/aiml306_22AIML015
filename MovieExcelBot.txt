This bot is designed to create a new CSV file named newmovies.csv that contains columns for id, title, and ratings for each movie. The bot extracts data from two existing CSV files (movies_metadata.csv and ratings_new.csv) and combines them using a database connection and data table operations.

Steps to Create the Bot
1. String Assign Action
Action: String Assign
Variable: FolderPath
Value: D:\movieexcelbot
This action assigns the folder path where the CSV files are stored to the variable FolderPath.

2. Database Connect Action for Movies Metadata
Action: Database Connect
Mode: Default Mode
Connection String: "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0; Data Source=$FolderPath$; Extended Properties='text';"
Session Name: file1
This action establishes a connection to the CSV file movies_metadata.csv using a local session named file1.

3. Database Export to Table Action for Movies Metadata
Action: Database Export to Table
Select Statement: SELECT id, original_title FROM movies_metadata.csv
Session Name: file1
Output Variable: datatable1
This action runs an SQL select statement to retrieve the id and original_title columns from movies_metadata.csv and stores the result in the datatable1 variable.

4. Database Connect Action for Ratings
Action: Database Connect
Mode: Default Mode
Connection String: "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0; Data Source=$FolderPath$; Extended Properties='text';"
Session Name: file2
This action establishes a connection to the CSV file ratings_new.csv using a local session named file2.

5. Database Export to Table Action for Ratings
Action: Database Export to Table
Select Statement: SELECT movieId, rating FROM ratings_new.csv
Session Name: file2
Output Variable: datatable2
This action runs an SQL select statement to retrieve the movieId and rating columns from ratings_new.csv and stores the result in the datatable2 variable.

6. Data Table Join Action
Action: Data Table Join
Data Table 1: datatable1
Data Table 1 Column: id
Data Table 2: datatable2
Data Table 2 Column: movieId
Join Type: Inner Join
Output Variable: final_output
This action performs an inner join between datatable1 and datatable2 based on the matching values of id from datatable1 and movieId from datatable2. The inner join ensures that only records with matching values in both tables are included in the final result. This is necessary to ensure that we only get ratings for movies that exist in the metadata file.

7. Excel Open Action
Action: Excel Open
File Path: D:\newmovies.csv
Mode: Desktop
Session Name: Default
This action opens a new or existing CSV file newmovies.csv in Excel using the default session.

8. Excel Write to Data Table
Action: Excel Write Data Table to File
Data Table: final_output
Sheet Name: Active Sheet
Cell: A1
Session Name: Default
This action writes the data from final_output to the active sheet of the opened CSV file starting at cell A1.

Explanation of Inner Join
An inner join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. In this context, it ensures that only the movies that exist in the movies_metadata.csv file and have corresponding ratings in the ratings_new.csv file are included in the final output. This is important because it prevents the inclusion of movies without ratings or ratings for movies not listed in the metadata, ensuring the accuracy and relevance of the combined data in the newmovies.csv file.
